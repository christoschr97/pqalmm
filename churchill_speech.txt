HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that attacks the immune system of humans, particularly the CD4 cells which are vital in defending the body against infections. This virus is known for being the precursor to AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, a condition characterized by the failure of the immune system to fend off opportunistic infections and diseases.

In the early 1980s, the world witnessed the emergence of HIV as a global health crisis. The virus, which is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing of needles, or from an infected mother to her child during childbirth or breastfeeding, brought about a pandemic that has taken millions of lives. Throughout the years, research and medical advancements have worked relentlessly to curb the spread and impact of this virus.

Currently, there are two main types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the most widespread type globally, whereas HIV-2 is mainly confined to West Africa. These viruses are retroviruses, meaning they replicate within a host by converting their RNA genomes into DNA, integrating this DNA into the host cell’s genome, and hijacking the cell’s machinery to produce new viral particles.

A significant development in the fight against HIV has been the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART involves a combination of medicines that work to prevent the virus from replicating in the body, thereby helping to maintain a person's immune system and reducing the chances of transmitting the virus to others. Although ART does not cure HIV, it has been monumental in extending the life expectancy of people living with HIV.

Furthermore, preventative measures have been at the forefront of controlling the spread of HIV. Programs promoting safer sex practices, needle exchange schemes, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have been instrumental in reducing new infections. Awareness and education campaigns have also played a crucial role, dispelling myths and stigma surrounding the virus, and promoting understanding and compassion towards those affected by HIV.
